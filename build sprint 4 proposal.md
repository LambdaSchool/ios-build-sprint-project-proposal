## Brainstorming

Add photos, notes, and sketches from your brain storming session. 
each entry has features including : date, location, insert and take pictures, notes, categories

	each entry is ideally a “day” on a trip

	entries can be added to “folder” which is ideally  a trip
_________________________________________________________

the folders will be organized in chronological order descending (newest top)

the folders will be presented as a blog post where there will be one representative photo where you can click on, which then brings you to the entries in that folder listed in chronological order
_________________________________________________________

the comprehensive map will show the latest photo tag at that location in the annotation view, click to go to a collectionview of album

the comprehensive map serves as an organized view of the photos taken in that country without clicking into each individual folder
_________________________________________________________

the app will have the following tabs at the bottom:
	1. content: an organized view of the folders (explained above)
	2. an add button: to add a new entry (goes to a view controller that creates an entry object)
	3. map view (explained above)
	4. word search (a tableview to search entries with name keyword)
	5. account and setting (using firebase to store photos, having a way to change passwor
