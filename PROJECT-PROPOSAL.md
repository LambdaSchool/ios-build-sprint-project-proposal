## Step 3: Top Features (Prioritize)

Add your top 3-5 features (core functionality) from the Prioritize brainstorming step. These should be things that are part of the MVP (not a log in screen). Build for the demo day (i.e.: Apple never shows how to log into the Apple ID on stage).

1. `<Feature 1: Track Number of Episodes Watched In Shows>`
2. `<Feature 2 Calculate How Many Episodes of a Show You Need To Watch In Order To Catch Up>`
3. `<Feature 3 Sort Filter/Shows By Highest Priority>`
4. `<Feature 4 Countdown Timer to Show When A New Season or Episode Will Air >`
5. `<Feature 5 Alert Notification To Remind You when your show is about to air >`

## Step 4: Sketch 

I know these are very crude/simple photos..just a first draft i promose the will become more eloquent as a couple future drafts are built. I will try attaching them elsewhere in case they cant be seen here.

## Part 2: Project Plan

Take a step away from your computer and go for a walk. Your brain will continue to think about your app idea.

1. Add your tasks to your Kanban board (Github Project/Trello)
2. Be specific in your tasks so that they are actionable.
    1. "Create View Controllers" is vague and isn't clear when you're finished
    2. "Create Table View Controller for GIFCell rows" and "Create Custom GIFTableViewCell" are specific
3. Organize your tasks (Drag and drop)
    1. Break down large tasks into subtasks
    2. If you don't know how to do a task, add to research it (i.e: "Research: AVFoundation Video Thumbnails API" or "Read: Core Graphics Programming Guide")
4. Start on your most difficult task first
5. Re-evaluate your progress each day and plan what you'll work on the next day
