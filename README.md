# Project Proposal for iOS Build Sprint

1. Fork and Clone this repository
2. Fill out the information below (Remove `<placeholders>` and add your answers)
3. Tag your TL and Instructor on your Pull Request

## Requirements

1. Team Members: Kelson Hartle, Sean Acres
2. App Name: "Private Yelp" Name TBD
3. App Description (3-5 sentences):

    Drop a pin at a restaurant you’re eating at and fill out a review then or later. It keeps a personal list of places you’ve eaten at so you can remember what restaurants were good, what food was good, and where they are.
    
4. Your #1 Customer (Who would use your app? Why now?)
 
    Our number one user would be someone who frequently goes out to restaurants and likes to document/share those experiences. Other services are more one-off as far as reviews and don't help you keep a list of your favorite places without unnecessary clutter. 
    
5. Github code repository: `<Create a Github Project>` N/A Dimitri said GitHub repos are being provided to us
6. Github Project/Trello Board: https://trello.com/b/8GvfNgGv/private-yelp-board
7. Create a Slack DM Group with your partner, TL, and Instructor and say "hi!"

## Top Features (Prioritize)

Add your top 3-5 features (core functionality) from the Prioritize brainstorming step. These should be things that are part of the MVP (not a log in screen). Build for the demo day (i.e.: Apple never shows how to log into the Apple ID on stage).

1. User can easily save/start a review of the place they are currently at. 
2. User can create a comprehensive review of a place including place name, place address, rating, text review, and photos
3. User can view a list of all the reviews/places they've saved
4. User can see on the map the places they've saved depending on the portion of map that's visible

## Part 2: Project Plan

Take a step away from your computer and go for a walk. Your brain will continue to think about your app idea.

1. Add your tasks to your Kanban board (Github Project/Trello)
2. Be specific in your tasks so that they are actionable.
    1. "Create View Controllers" is vague and isn't clear when you're finished
    2. "Create Table View Controller for GIFCell rows" and "Create Custom GIFTableViewCell" are specific
3. Organize your tasks (Drag and drop)
    1. Break down large tasks into subtasks
    2. If you don't know how to do a task, add to research it (i.e: "Research: AVFoundation Video Thumbnails API" or "Read: Core Graphics Programming Guide")
4. Start on your most difficult task first
5. Re-evaluate your progress each day and plan what you'll work on the next day
