# Project Proposal for iOS Build Sprint

1. Fork and Clone this repository
2. Fill out the information below (Remove `<placeholders>` and add your answers)
3. Tag your TL and Instructor on your Pull Request

## Requirements

1. Team Members: Skye Leahy
2. App Name: `Translation App`
3. App Description (3-5 sentences):

    `This iOS Swift app takes any sentence or word, detects the source language, then translates it to a specific target language.`
    
4. Your #1 Customer (Who would use your app? Why now?)
 
    `Language learners, translators, bilingual people, etc.`
    
5. Github code repository: `<Create a Github Project>`a
6. Github Project/Trello Board: https://trello.com/b/j8kJvEJw/translation-app
7. Create a Slack DM Group with your partner, TL, and Instructor and say "hi!"

## Part 1: Brainstorming

Add photos, notes, and sketches from your brain storming session. 

1. Brainstorming (Photo / Sketch)
    1. Mind Map (15 minutes)
       -> Already had idea of app before the mind map session
    2. Organize a List (15 minutes)
        a. Does it translate all languages or a specific language?
        b. Can you translate both ways?
    3. Prioritize (5 minutes)
        1. What features does your #1 customer need most?
        2. Choose 3-5 features that make the core app experience
        3. Add these features to your `## Top Features` section
    4. Sketch (15 minutes)
        1. Draw a rectangle in the center of a paper
        2. Sketch a rough idea of what buttons, labels, images would be on the screen
        3. Repeat this for 3-5 of your top features
        4. Add annotations to your sketches (i.e.: point out how gesture interactions or animations might work)
        5. Take a photo of each mockup
    5. Share (15 minutes)
        1. Pair up with a fellow student and show them your idea (Screenshare on Zoom)
        2. Take notes and write down any of their ideas
2. If you have tons of ideas, set a timer again and keep going.
3. Don't filter yourself in the brainstorming phase, you want to capture everything and anything

## Top Features (Prioritize)

Add your top 3-5 features (core functionality) from the Prioritize brainstorming step. These should be things that are part of the MVP (not a log in screen). Build for the demo day (i.e.: Apple never shows how to log into the Apple ID on stage).

1. This will help the customer translate text queries into a language they want to understand it in.
2. This will help the customer by enabling them to use a simple mobile app to translate text instead of via a desktop application, etc.
3. Accesses Google Translate API in order to implement translation functionality without specifically adding in language dictionary files and accessing them via other code.
4. Accesses Google API to detect source language without specific user input :)
5. Sets background image related to text query entered in by user; provides a more in-depth experience.
