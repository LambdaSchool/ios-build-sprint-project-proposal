# Project Proposal for iOS Build Sprint

1. Fork and Clone this repository
2. Fill out the information below (Remove `<placeholders>` and add your answers)
3. Tag your TL and Instructor on your Pull Request

## Requirements

1. Team Members: @joshrutkowski (me), David Wright, Sal
2. App Name: Hydrate
3. App Description:

Hydrate is a beverage intake tracker. Users can track exactly how much water they consume throughout the day and add customized settings for different measurements (cups, oz, ml) and types of beverages (water, alcohol, tea, soda, etc). Users are reminded throughout the day to drink and log the data.
    
4. Your #1 Customer (Who would use your app? Why now?)
 
 People concerned about how much water they are drinking.
    
5. Github code repository: To do
6. Github Project/Trello Board: To do
7. Create a Slack DM Group with your partner, TL, and Instructor and say "hi!"

## Part 1: Brainstorming

Add photos, notes, and sketches from your brain storming session. 

1. Brainstorming (Photo / Sketch)
    1. Mind Map
    
    2. Feature List:
    
    - Log water intake: short press button makes it easy to log by default value. Long press allows custom logging.
    - Settings page allows custom settings, app integrations, and default values
    - Current water level displayed on main page with custom wave-like animation
    - Integrate with watchOS to log quickly on the go
    - Integrate with HealthKit to export data to other apps
    - History page shows chart of intake levels and beverages consumed
    - Reminders throughout the day
    - Share results with friends
    - Badge achievements (3-day streak, 7-day streak, etc)
       
    3. Prioritizd List:
    - Log water intake: short press button makes it easy to log by default value. Long press allows custom logging.
    - View history of water intake
    - Ability to track other beverages and view how much of each beverage is consumed

    4. Sketch

## Top Features (Prioritize)

Add your top 3-5 features (core functionality) from the Prioritize brainstorming step. These should be things that are part of the MVP (not a log in screen). Build for the demo day (i.e.: Apple never shows how to log into the Apple ID on stage).

1. Log water: short press for default, long press for custom
2. Notifications to remind user to drink
3. HealthKit integration

## Part 2: Project Plan

Take a step away from your computer and go for a walk. Your brain will continue to think about your app idea.

1. Add your tasks to your Kanban board (Github Project/Trello)
2. Be specific in your tasks so that they are actionable.
    1. "Create View Controllers" is vague and isn't clear when you're finished
    2. "Create Table View Controller for GIFCell rows" and "Create Custom GIFTableViewCell" are specific
3. Organize your tasks (Drag and drop)
    1. Break down large tasks into subtasks
    2. If you don't know how to do a task, add to research it (i.e: "Research: AVFoundation Video Thumbnails API" or "Read: Core Graphics Programming Guide")
4. Start on your most difficult task first
5. Re-evaluate your progress each day and plan what you'll work on the next day
