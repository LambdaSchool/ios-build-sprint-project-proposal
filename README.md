    Welcome to the Mortgage Calculator!
    
     ` Essentially, this app will help you get a clear image of the financial investment you make when you decide to purchase a home and finance it with a mortgage. `
     ` If you're trying to get an idea about what you can afford first before you start looking around for houses, this app would be perfect for that!`
     ` In this app, you'll input a few details about your (hypothetical or actual) mortgage, like the total amount of the mortgage loan, the interest rate, and the term of the loan.`
     ` It'll tell you how much you'll be spending on your mortgage in total (including interest), your monthly payment, `
     
4. Your #1 Customer (Who would use your app? Why now?)
 
    `Anyone who's thinking about or looking into buying a home, maybe even someone in real estate who sometimes just needs to do some quick math for his customers, it can be a very reliable tool!`
    
5. Github code repository: https://github.com/iOSPT6-Mortgage-Calculator
6. Github Project/Trello Board: https://github.com/orgs/iOSPT6-Mortgage-Calculator/projects/1
7. Create a Slack DM Group with your partner, TL, and Instructor and say "hi!"

## Part 1: Brainstorming

Add photos, notes, and sketches from your brain storming session. 

1. Brainstorming (Photo / Sketch)
    1. Mind Map (15 minutes)
        1. Set a timer for 15 minutes
        2. Grab a piece of paper and write your app name in the center
        3. Add as many ideas and connections (Don't stop early, keep going until the timer ends)
        4. If you still have ideas, reset the timer and do it again
        5. Take a photo of your mind map and upload it to your proposal (YourName-Mindmap.jpg)
    2. Organize a List (15 minutes)
        1. Set a timer for 15 minutes
        2. Make a list on paper (or Markdown) and capture all your ideas from the mindmap
        3. If new ideas appear, write those down too
        4. Take a photo of your organized list and upload it to your proposal (YourName-List.jpg or YourName-List.md)
    3. Prioritize (5 minutes)
        1. What features does your #1 customer need most? 
        `the ability to receive reminders and to log and track doses of medication inside the app`
        2. Choose 3-5 features that make the core app experience
        3. Add these features to your `## Top Features` section
    4. Sketch (15 minutes)
        1. Draw a rectangle in the center of a paper
        2. Sketch a rough idea of what buttons, labels, images would be on the screen
        3. Repeat this for 3-5 of your top features
        4. Add annotations to your sketches (i.e.: point out how gesture interactions or animations might work)
        5. Take a photo of each mockup
    5. Share (15 minutes)
        1. Pair up with a fellow student and show them your idea (Screenshare on Zoom)
        2. Take notes and write down any of their ideas
2. If you have tons of ideas, set a timer again and keep going.
3. Don't filter yourself in the brainstorming phase, you want to capture everything and anything

## Top Features (Prioritize)

Add your top 3-5 features (core functionality) from the Prioritize brainstorming step. These should be things that are part of the MVP (not a log in screen). Build for the demo day (i.e.: Apple never shows how to log into the Apple ID on stage).

1. ` The app will take the user's inputs and run calculations in the background to display to the user `

2. ` return monthly payment `

3. ` return total mortgage cost `

## Part 2: Project Plan

Take a step away from your computer and go for a walk. Your brain will continue to think about your app idea.

1. Add your tasks to your Kanban board (Github Project/Trello)
2. Be specific in your tasks so that they are actionable.
    1. "Create View Controllers" is vague and isn't clear when you're finished
    2. "Create Table View Controller for GIFCell rows" and "Create Custom GIFTableViewCell" are specific
3. Organize your tasks (Drag and drop)
    1. Break down large tasks into subtasks
    2. If you don't know how to do a task, add to research it (i.e: "Research: AVFoundation Video Thumbnails API" or "Read: Core Graphics Programming Guide")
4. Start on your most difficult task first
5. Re-evaluate your progress each day and plan what you'll work on the next day
